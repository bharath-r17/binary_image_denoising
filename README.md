# BINARY_IMAGE_DENOISING-IMAGE-PROCESSING
The project was made as a solution for the problem statement 'Denoising Binary Images without loss of information' 
given in the hackathon 'Hackwell 2.0' organised ny JSSATE-B and Honeywell. This project finished among top 10 Finalists in the hackathon

### Algorithm
 - Taking Binary Image as input 
 - Scaling image (90% of the original or other)
 - Applying Max Flow Min Cut Algo
 - Convolving with the Identity Kernel
 - Median Blur (k_size needs to choosen)
 - Descaling output ( to original size)
 - Binirizing it (for the crispness)
